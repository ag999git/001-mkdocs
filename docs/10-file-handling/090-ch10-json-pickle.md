## RESEARCH / PROJECT QUESTION

## Title: “Comparative Study of JSON and Pickle for Data Serialization in Python with Real-World Applications”

## Problem Statement

Develop a Python system to:

1.  Serialize and deserialize data using:
    -   JSON
    -   Pickle
2.  Compare:
    -   Performance
    -   Security
    -   Portability
3.  Demonstrate:
    -   API-style JSON usage
    -   Limitations of JSON
    -   Risks of Pickle

----------

## Objectives

### A. Functional Tasks

-   Store and retrieve:
    -   Dictionary
    -   List
    -   Custom class

----------

### B. API Simulation

-   Convert data → JSON string
-   Simulate sending/receiving data

----------

### C. Error Handling

-   Handle:
    -   Invalid JSON
    -   Unsupported data types

----------

### D. Security Study

-   Show why Pickle is unsafe
-   Show safe JSON usage

----------

## ANSWER (CONCEPTUAL)

### Key Findings

-   JSON:
    -   Portable, safe, widely used
-   Pickle:
    -   Powerful but unsafe
-   APIs use JSON because:
    -   Language-independent
    -   Text-based

## Comparison Table

| Feature | JSON | Pickle | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portability | High | Low | APIs |
| Security | High | Low | Web |
| Object Support | Limited | Full | Python apps |
| Speed | Medium | High | Internal storage |


### Final Insight 

> Use **JSON** for:

-   APIs
-   Web
-   Data exchange

> Use **Pickle** for:

-   Python-only programs
-   Complex object storage

## Script

```python

# PROJECT: JSON vs Pickle Comparison Study

import json
import pickle

# STEP 1: Define class. Custom class to demonstrate JSON and Pickle handling of complex objects
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name  # Student's name
        self.marks = marks  # Student's marks

# STEP 2: Create data. A simple dictionary to be serialized using both JSON and Pickle
data = {
    "name": "Alice",  # Student's name
    "marks": 60  # Student's marks
}

# STEP 3: JSON serialization
json_str = json.dumps(data)  # Convert Python dict to JSON string
print("JSON String:", json_str)  # Output: JSON String: {"name": "Alice", "marks": 60}

# STEP 4: JSON deserialization
json_obj = json.loads(json_str)  # Convert JSON string back to Python dict
print("JSON Object:", json_obj)  # Output: JSON Object: {'name': 'Alice', 'marks': 60}

# STEP 5: Pickle serialization - writing to file
with open("data.pkl", "wb") as f:  # Open file in binary write mode
    pickle.dump(data, f)  # Serialize Python dict to binary format and write to file

# STEP 6: Pickle deserialization - reading from file
with open("data.pkl", "rb") as f:  # Open file in binary read mode
    pkl_obj = pickle.load(f)  # Deserialize binary data back to Python dict

print("Pickle Object:", pkl_obj)  # Output: Pickle Object: {'name': 'Alice', 'marks': 60}

# STEP 7: JSON limitation
student = Student("Alice", 60)  # Create an instance of Student class

# STEP 8: ERROR: JSON cannot serialize custom Python objects
# json.dumps(student)  # TypeError: Object of type Student is not JSON serializable

# Solution: Convert to dict
json_str = json.dumps(student.__dict__)
print("Converted Object:", json_str)  # Output: Converted Object: {"name": "Alice", "marks": 60}

# STEP 9: Pickle can handle custom objects
with open("student.pkl", "wb") as f:  # Open file in binary write mode
    pickle.dump(student, f)  # Serialize custom object to binary format and write to file
with open("student.pkl", "rb") as f:  # Open file in binary read mode
    loaded_student = pickle.load(f)  # Deserialize binary data back to custom object
print("Loaded Student:", loaded_student.name, loaded_student.marks) # Output: Loaded Student: Alice 60

# STEP 10: Security warning
# NEVER do this with unknown files
# pickle.load(open("unknown.pkl", "rb"))  # This can execute arbitrary code if the file is malicious. Always ensure you trust the source of the pickle file before loading it.

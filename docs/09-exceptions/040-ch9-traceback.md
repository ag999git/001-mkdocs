# Digging Into Exceptions: `sys` and `traceback`

So far in this chapter, you've used `try`/`except` to catch errors, and probably printed something like `print(e)` to see what went wrong. That works fine for simple cases — but real errors carry a lot more information than just a short message: *which* function it happened in, *which line* of code triggered it, and the entire chain of function calls that led there. This section looks at two built-in modules, `sys` and `traceback`, that let you dig into all of that detail directly — the same information Python normally prints to your screen when a program crashes, except now available to you as data you can inspect, log, or format however you like.

This is especially useful once your programs grow beyond a handful of functions: a bare error message like `"division by zero"` doesn't tell you *where* in a large program that happened, but a full traceback does — which is exactly why professional debugging and error-reporting tools are built around this same information.

## Project: Study of Exceptions Using `sys` and `traceback`

*(This is the original research question from the printed book, kept exactly as written. A short set of optional follow-up questions has been added after the model answer.)*

> **Research Question:** "How does Python internally represent exceptions, and how can the `sys` and `traceback` modules be used to extract, analyze, and present detailed information about errors?"

### Details of the Problem

1. What is an **exception object**?
2. Role of:
   - `sys.exc_info()`
   - `traceback` module
3. Structure of:
   - Exception type
   - Exception value
   - Traceback object
4. How Python builds a **stack trace**
5. Difference between:
   - Basic error message (`str(e)`)
   - Full traceback
6. Practical uses:
   - Debugging
   - Error reporting

## Answer

### Step 1: What is an exception object?

Whenever an error occurs in Python, it isn't just a plain text message being displayed — Python actually creates a real **object**, built from an exception class (like `ZeroDivisionError` or `ValueError`), and that object carries three pieces of information along with it:

| What It Stores | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | Which kind of exception this is (its class), e.g. `ZeroDivisionError` |
| **Message** | A human-readable description of what went wrong, e.g. `"division by zero"` |
| **Traceback** | The full chain of function calls that led to the error — see Step 4 below |

This is exactly why `except ZeroDivisionError as e:` works the way it does: `e` is a genuine object, not just a string, so it can carry all of this extra detail with it.

### Step 2: What does `sys.exc_info()` do?

`sys.exc_info()` is a function from Python's built-in `sys` module. When called from inside an `except` block, it hands back **three related pieces of information about the exception currently being handled**, bundled together as a tuple:

```python
e_type, e_value, e_tb = sys.exc_info()
```

| Component | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `e_type` | The exception's class (e.g. `<class 'ZeroDivisionError'>`) |
| `e_value` | The exception object itself — the same thing you'd get from `except ... as e` |
| `e_tb` | A **traceback object**, describing the full chain of calls that led to the error |

> **New term — "tuple":** a tuple is simply a fixed, ordered group of values, written with commas (and often parentheses) — here, three separate pieces of information are being returned together as one unit. See the [official Python docs on tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuples) if this is unfamiliar.

### Step 3: What does the `traceback` module do?

While `sys.exc_info()` gives you the *raw ingredients* of an error, the `traceback` module is what turns those ingredients into something readable — extracting and formatting the full call history. Its most useful functions:

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `traceback.extract_tb()` | Breaks a traceback object down into a structured list you can loop over in your own code |
| `traceback.format_exc()` | Produces the complete traceback as one formatted string, ready to print or log |
| `traceback.print_exc()` | Prints the full traceback directly to the screen, without you needing to build the string yourself |

### Step 4: How Python builds a stack trace

A **stack trace** (also called a "call stack" or simply "traceback") is a record of exactly which functions were running, and in what order, at the moment an error occurred. Each time one function calls another, Python adds a new entry — called a **frame** — onto an internal stack; when an exception is raised, Python has, at that exact moment, a complete record of every function call that led to that point, from the very first one down to where the error actually happened.

> **New term — "stack":** in programming, a "stack" is a structure where the most recently added item is the first one removed — think of a physical stack of plates. Python's *call stack* works the same way: the function that was called most recently sits "on top," and as functions finish and return, they're removed from the stack in reverse order. This is why a traceback reads top-to-bottom as "outermost call → innermost call, right down to where the error happened."

### Step 5: Basic error message vs. full traceback

| Feature | `str(e)` | `traceback` module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detail level | Low — just the error message | High — full context |
| Shows *where* it happened (file, line) | No | Yes |
| Shows the *full call stack* | No | Yes |

In short: `str(e)` tells you *what* went wrong; the `traceback` module tells you *what, where, and how you got there*.

### Step 6: Practical uses

1. **Debugging** — while developing, a full traceback lets you jump straight to the exact line that failed, rather than guessing based on a bare message alone.
2. **Error reporting / logging** — production programs often catch exceptions, then use `traceback.format_exc()` to write the *full* error detail to a log file, while showing the user a much simpler, friendlier message on screen. This is precisely the technique demonstrated in the script below.

## Optional Follow-Up Questions

*(Additional questions, not part of the original printed book, for readers who want to explore this topic further.)*

1. Try calling `sys.exc_info()` *outside* of an `except` block (i.e. when no exception is currently being handled). What does it return?
2. `traceback.print_exc()` and `traceback.format_exc()` produce essentially the same information — what's the practical difference between printing it directly versus getting it back as a string? When might you prefer one over the other?
3. Look up Python's newer `exception.__traceback__` attribute (available directly on any exception object, without needing `sys.exc_info()` at all). How does using it compare to the approach shown in this section?

---

## Part 2: Script Question

*(Original project task from the printed book.)*

> Write a Python program that:
>
> 1. Defines at least **two nested functions**
> 2. Intentionally generates an exception (e.g., division by zero)
> 3. Uses:
>    - `try`-`except`
>    - `sys.exc_info()`
>    - `traceback.extract_tb()`
> 4. Prints:
>    - Exception type
>    - Exception message
>    - File name
>    - Line number
>    - Function name
>    - Code line causing error
> 5. Also prints the **full formatted traceback**
> 6. Ensures the program continues after handling the exception

## Script (Answer)

```python
import sys
import traceback


# Step 1: build a chain of nested function calls, so the eventual
# error has a real call stack behind it -- level1() calls level2(),
# which calls level3(), where the error actually happens.

def level1():
    print("1. Inside level1()")
    level2()


def level2():
    print("2. Inside level2()")
    level3()


def level3():
    print("3. Inside level3()")
    x = 10 / 0   # deliberately triggers ZeroDivisionError


# ---------------- Main execution ----------------

try:
    # Step 2: kick off the call chain -- the error, once it
    # happens three levels deep, will be caught by the except
    # block below, together with its FULL call history.
    print("1. Starting program")
    level1()

except Exception as e:
    print("4. Exception caught in except block")

    # Step 3: sys.exc_info() gives us the exception's type, its
    # value (the actual exception object), and a traceback object
    # describing the full chain of calls that led here.
    e_type, e_value, e_tb = sys.exc_info()

    print("Type:", e_type)      # <class 'ZeroDivisionError'>
    print("Message:", e_value)  # division by zero

    # -------- Step 4: Structured Traceback --------
    print("5. Extracted Traceback Details:")

    # traceback.extract_tb() converts the raw traceback object into
    # a list of "frame summaries" -- one per function call in the
    # chain -- each describing where that particular call happened.
    tb_list = traceback.extract_tb(e_tb)

    print("6. Printing traceback details for each frame:")
    for frame in tb_list:
        # Each frame unpacks into four pieces of information:
        filename, lineno, func_name, text = frame
        print("File:", filename)      # the file the call happened in
        print("Line:", lineno)        # the line number of that call
        print("Function:", func_name) # the function that call was inside
        print("Code:", text)          # the actual line of code involved
        print("-" * 40)

    # -------- Step 5: Full Formatted Traceback --------
    print("7. Full Traceback:")
    # traceback.format_exc() gives us the SAME information Python
    # would print automatically on an uncaught crash -- but as a
    # string we control, which we could just as easily write to a
    # log file instead of printing to the screen.
    print(traceback.format_exc())

finally:
    # Step 6: this always runs, proving the program survives the
    # exception instead of crashing outright.
    print("8. Program continues after exception handling")
```

### Sample Output (abridged)

```
1. Starting program
1. Inside level1()
2. Inside level2()
3. Inside level3()
4. Exception caught in except block
Type: <class 'ZeroDivisionError'>
Message: division by zero
5. Extracted Traceback Details:
6. Printing traceback details for each frame:
File: example.py
Line: 24
Function: <module>
Code: level1()
----------------------------------------
File: example.py
Line: 8
Function: level1
Code: level2()
----------------------------------------
File: example.py
Line: 13
Function: level2
Code: level3()
----------------------------------------
File: example.py
Line: 18
Function: level3
Code: x = 10 / 0
----------------------------------------
7. Full Traceback:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 24, in <module>
    level1()
  File "example.py", line 8, in level1
    level2()
  File "example.py", line 13, in level2
    level3()
  File "example.py", line 18, in level3
    x = 10 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

8. Program continues after exception handling
```

(Exact line numbers and the file name will vary depending on how you run the script.)

## Part 3: Explanation of the Script

### Execution Flow

1. `level1()` is called → it calls `level2()`
2. `level2()` is called → it calls `level3()`
3. `level3()` runs → the error occurs (`10 / 0`)
4. Since nothing inside `level1()`, `level2()`, or `level3()` catches the error, it travels all the way back up to the `try` block in the main program, and control jumps to `except`
5. The exception's full information is extracted and displayed

### The same flow, as a flowchart 

![Flowchart](/001-mkdocs/resources/ch-9-exceptions-august-2026-digging-into-exceptions-sys-traceback.png)


### Key Concepts Explained

#### A. Why use nested function calls?

Calling `level1() → level2() → level3()` deliberately creates a multi-step **call stack**, so the resulting traceback has several frames in it — this makes it much easier to see, concretely, how a traceback records an entire *chain* of calls, not just the single line where the error finally occurred.

#### B. `sys.exc_info()`

Captures three things about the exception currently being handled:

- **Type** → here, `ZeroDivisionError`
- **Value** → the exception object, whose message is `"division by zero"`
- **Traceback** → the full execution path that led to the error

#### C. `traceback.extract_tb()`

Takes the raw traceback object and breaks it down into a list you can actually loop through in your own code — one entry per function call in the chain, each giving you the **file**, **line number**, **function name**, and **code text** for that step.

#### D. `traceback.format_exc()`

Produces the **complete, human-readable traceback** as a single string — the same format Python shows automatically when a program crashes, but available to you programmatically, so you can log it, email it, or display it however your program needs.

## Part 4: Comparison Tables

### `sys` vs. `traceback`

| Feature | `sys.exc_info()` | `traceback` module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output type | A raw tuple of three values | Structured lists / ready-formatted strings |
| Detail level | Medium — the raw ingredients | High — fully processed and readable |
| Ease of use | Moderate — you do the formatting yourself | Easy — built-in functions do the formatting for you |
| Typical use case | Low-level inspection inside your own code | Debugging output and error logging |

### Levels of Exception Information

| Level | Tool | What You Get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic | `str(e)` | Just the error message |
| Medium | `sys.exc_info()` | Exception type + the exception object itself |
| Detailed | `traceback` module | The full call stack — file, line, function, and code for every step |

---

## Quick Recap

| Step | What Happens | Function/Tool Used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | An error occurs somewhere in a chain of function calls | (any code that raises an exception) |
| 2 | Extract the exception's type, value, and traceback | `sys.exc_info()` |
| 3 | Break the traceback into per-call details | `traceback.extract_tb()` |
| 4 | Get the same information as one ready-to-use string | `traceback.format_exc()` |
| 5 | Print the traceback directly, without building a string yourself | `traceback.print_exc()` |
| 6 | Guarantee the program keeps running afterward | `finally` |

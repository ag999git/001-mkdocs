### Discussion: Python Integers (`int`) (With some advance concepts included)

Python’s `int` type is one of the most powerful integer implementations among modern programming languages.  
Unlike C, C++, or Java, Python integers are **arbitrary-precision**, memory-managed objects with a well-defined internal representation.

This section covers Python `int` in depth.

---

#### 1. What Is a Python Integer?

- Represents whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero).
- Entirely implemented in C (CPython) as a structure called `PyLongObject`.
- Immutable: any arithmetic operation creates a new integer object.

```python
x = 10
x = x + 5   # creates a new int object; the old one is unused
```

---

#### 2. Arbitrary Precision (Unlimited Size)

Python’s `int` has **no fixed upper limit**.

- Grows automatically as needed.
- Limited only by available RAM.

Examples:
```python
x = 10 ** 1000
#print(x) # If uncommented will give a very large number
print(len(str(x))) # Will give the number of digits ie 1001
```

In languages like C, Java, C++, the size (32-bit, 64-bit) is fixed.  
Python internally uses a dynamic array of machine words to store large integers.


---

#### 3. Integer Operations

##### Arithmetic
`+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `/`, `%`, `**`

Example:
```python
a = 17
b = 5
print(a / b) # 3.4 This will print the float division result
print(a // b) # 3 Floor division.
```

#### Floor division always rounds toward `negative infinity`:
```python
print(-15/4) # Output: -3.75
print(15/-4) # Output: -3.75
```

---

#### 4. Bitwise Operations (Advanced Feature)

Python supports full bitwise operations:

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `&` | bitwise AND |
| `|` | bitwise OR |
| `^` | XOR |
| `~` | bitwise NOT |
| `<<` | left shift |
| `>>` | right shift |

Example:
```python
print(10 << 3)    # 80
```

#### 5. Advance concept:- Explanation of Bitwise Operation: `10 << 3`

<details>
<summary>5. Advance concept:- Explanation of Bitwise Operation: `10 << 3`</summary>

The operator `<<` is the **bitwise left shift** operator.  
It shifts the binary representation of a number **to the left** by a specified number of positions.

---

###### Step 1: Convert 10 to binary
```
10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary)
```

---

###### Step 2: Shift left by 3 positions
`10 << 3` means:

```
1010 << 3 = 1010 000
```

Three zeros are added on the right.

---

###### Step 3: Convert result back to decimal
Binary `1010000` equals:

```
1×64 + 1×16 = 80
```

So:
```
10 << 3 = 80
```

---

##### Why it works
Shifting left by `n` bits is equivalent to multiplying by `2ⁿ`:

```
10 << 3  =  10 × (2³)
         =  10 × 8
         =  80
```

---

##### Final Answer
```
10 << 3 = 80
```

#### 6. Advance concept:- Meaning of the Statement:- “Large integers can be shifted arbitrarily because Python supports arbitrary precision.”


<details> 
<summary>6. Advance concept:- Meaning of the Statement:- “Large integers can be shifted arbitrarily because Python supports arbitrary precision.”</summary>summary

---

###### 1. What is arbitrary precision?

- In many languages (C, C++, Java), integers have a **fixed number of bits** (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit).
- This means numbers have a maximum possible size.
- Shifting them too far can cause:
  - overflow  
  - loss of bits  
  - wrap-around  
  - undefined behavior  

Python is different:

- Python integers have **no fixed size limit**.
- They automatically grow to any size, limited only by available memory.

---

###### 2. What does “shifted arbitrarily” mean?

- Bitwise left shift (`<<`) adds zeros to the right side of a binary number.
- In fixed-size languages, shifting too far is impossible or unsafe.
- **In Python, you can shift a number by any number of bits**, even thousands or millions.

Example:
```python
x = 5
y = x << 1000    # shift by 1000 bits
```
This works normally in Python.

---

###### 3. Example of a large shift

```python
x = 1
y = x << 200
print(y)
```

Output (a very large integer):
```
1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376
```

Python handles this because it expands the integer size automatically.

---

###### 4. Why Python can do this

- Bit shifts generate larger binary numbers.
- Python does not restrict integer size to 32 or 64 bits.
- It creates a larger integer object as needed.
- Therefore, no overflow occurs.

---

###### 5. Summary

- Python integers can grow to any size → **arbitrary precision**.
- Bit shifting (`<<`) can be done a limitless number of times.
- Python will automatically allocate more memory to store the larger integer.
- This is why **large integers can be shifted arbitrarily** in Python.

#### 7. Type Conversions

##### Convert to int:
```python
int("123") # string to int because "123" is a valid integer representation
int(" 456 ") # string with whitespace to int
int(3.14) # float -> int (truncates) because 3.14 is a float
int(True) # 1 Since True is 1
int(False) # 0 Since False is 0
int("0b101", 2) # binary string to int because "0b101" is a valid binary representation
int("0o77", 8) # octal string to int because "0o77" is a valid octal representation
int("0x1A", 16) # hexadecimal string to int because "0x1A" is a valid hexadecimal representation
int("-42") # negative string to int because "-42" is a valid integer representation
int("+99") # positive string to int because "+99" is a valid integer representation
int("007") # string with leading zeros to int because "007" is a valid integer representation
int(1e3) # scientific notation float to int (truncates) because 1e3 is a float
# Following if uncommented will raise exception
#int("") # raises ValueError because empty string cannot be converted to int
#int("abc") # raises ValueError because "abc" is not a valid integer representation
#int(None) # raises TypeError because None cannot be converted to int
#int([]) # raises TypeError because empty list cannot be converted to int
#int([1, 2]) # raises TypeError because non-empty list cannot be converted to int

```

#### 8. Integer to other types:
```python
print(float(5)) # 5.0 because int can be converted to float
print(complex(3)) # (3+0j) # int promoted to complex
print(str(123)) # "123" # int to string
```

---

#### 9. Relationship of int with `bool` (Subclassing)

In Python:
```
bool is a subclass of int
```

```python
print(issubclass(bool, int)) # True Since bool is a subclass of int
print(isinstance(True, int)) # True Since True is an instance of int
print(isinstance(False, int)) # True Since False is an instance of int
print(True + 1) # 2 Since True is 1
print(False + 1) # 1 Since False is 0
print(True * 10) # 10 Since True is 1
print(False * 10) # 0 Since False is 0

print(True > False) # True Since True is greater than False
print(False < True) # True Since False is less than True
print(sum([True, False, True, True])) # 3 Since True is 1 and False is 0
print([True, False, True].count(True)) # 2 Count of True in the list
print([True, False, True].count(False)) # 1 Count of False in the list
print([True, False, True].index(False)) # 1 Index of first occurrence of False
print(True.__class__) # <class 'bool'> Since True is an instance of bool
print(False.__class__) # <class 'bool'> Since False is an instance of bool
print(repr(True)) # 'True' Since repr(True) returns the string 'True'

print(str(True)) # 'True' Since str(True) returns the string 'True'
print(str(False)) # 'False' Since str(False) returns the string 'False'
print(hash(True)) # 1 Since hash(True) returns 1

print(hex(int(False))) # '0x0' Since hex(int(False)) returns the hexadecimal representation of 0
print(oct(int(True))) # '0o1' Since oct(int(True)) returns the octal representation of 1
print(oct(int(False))) # '0o0' Since oct(int(False)) returns the octal representation of 0
print(True.__and__(False)) # False Since True AND False is False
print(True.__or__(False)) # True Since True OR False is True
print(True.__xor__(False)) # True Since True XOR False is True
print(False.__and__(True)) # False Since False AND True is False
print(False.__or__(True)) # True Since False OR True is True
print(False.__xor__(True)) # True Since False XOR True is True
print(True.bit_length()) # 1 Since bit length of 1 is 1
print(False.bit_length()) # 0 Since bit length of 0 is 0
print((True, False)) # (True, False) Since this is a tuple containing True and False
print([True, False]) # [True, False] Since this is a list containing True and False
print({True: "yes", False: "no"}) # {True: 'yes', False: 'no'} Since this is a dictionary with boolean keys
print({True, False}) # {False, True} Since this is a set containing True and False
print(len({True, False})) # 2 Since the set has two elements
print(sorted([False, True, True, False])) # [False, False, True, True] Since the list is sorted
print(all([True, True, True])) # True Since all elements are True
print(all([True, False, True])) # False Since not all elements are True
print(any([False, False, False])) # False Since no elements are True
print(any([False, True, False])) # True Since at least one element is True
print(map(int, [True, False, True])) # <map object> Since map returns a map object
print(list(map(int, [True, False, True]))) # [1, 0, 1] Since list converts map to a list
print(filter(bool, [0, 1, "", "Hello", [], [1]])) # <filter object> Since filter returns a filter object
print(list(filter(bool, [0, 1, "", "Hello", [], [1]]))) # [1, 'Hello', [1]] Since list converts filter to a list
print(zip([True, False], [1, 0])) # <zip object> Since zip returns a zip object
print(list(zip([True, False], [1, 0]))) # [(True, 1), (False, 0)] Since list converts zip to a list
print(divmod(5, True)) # (5, 0) Since divmod returns quotient and remainder
#print(divmod(5, False)) # Raises ZeroDivisionError Since dividing by False (zero) is not allowed
try:
    print(divmod(5, False))
except  ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by False (zero)")
 
print(pow(2, True)) # 2 Since 2 raised to the power of True (1) is 2
print(pow(2, False)) # 1 Since 2 raised to the power of False (0) is 1
print(abs(True)) # 1 Since absolute value of True (1) is 1

print(round(True)) # 1 Since rounding True (1) is 1
print(round(False)) # 0 Since rounding False (0) is 0
print(float(True)) # 1.0 Since float conversion of True (1) is 1.0
print(float(False)) # 0.0 Since float conversion of False (0) is 0.0
print(complex(True)) # (1+0j) Since complex conversion of True (1) is (1+0j)
print(complex(False)) # 0j Since complex conversion of False (0) is 0j
print(divmod(5, True)) # (5, 0) Since divmod returns quotient and remainder
#print(divmod(5, False)) # Raises ZeroDivisionError Since dividing by False (zero) is not allowed

```

Meaning:
- `True` behaves as `1`
- `False` behaves as `0`



---

#### 10. Interactions of int with float and complex (Type Promotion)

Python uses numeric tower widening:

```
int → float → complex
```

Examples:
```python
print(5 + 2.5) # 7.5 int promoted to float
print(5 + 2j) # (5+2j) int promoted to complex
```

##### 10.1 What is Numeric tower widening in Python?

> When Python performs arithmetic between numbers of **different types**, it automatically converts (“promotes”) the smaller, simpler type into the larger, more capable type **so that the operation makes sense and no information is lost**.

Python follows this hierarchy:

`int → float → complex` 

This is called the **numeric tower**.

---

---

#### Advance Concept:- 11. Memory Usage

Memory increases with size of the integer.

Approximate formula:
```
24 bytes + 30 bits per digit (on 64-bit systems)
```

Example:
```python
import  sys
print(sys.getsizeof(10**100)) # Gives size of a large integer in bytes
print(sys.getsizeof(-10**100)) # Gives size of a large negative integer in bytes
print(10**1000) # Prints a very large integer
print(-10**1000) # Prints a very large negative integer
print(10**1000 + 10**999) # Addition of large integers
print(10**1000 - 10**999) # Subtraction of large integers
print(10**1000 * 10**999) # Multiplication of large integers
print(10**1000 // 10**999) # Floor division of large integers
print(10**1000 % 10**999) # Modulus of large integers
print(pow(10**100, 2)) # Power of a large integer
print(divmod(10**1000, 10**999)) # Divmod of large integers
print(10**1000 == 10**1000) # Equality comparison of large integers
print(10**1000 > 10**999) # Greater than comparison of large integers
print(10**1000 < 10**999) # Less than comparison of large integers
print(hash(10**1000)) # Hash of a large integer
print(abs(-10**1000)) # Absolute value of a large negative integer

# print(int(None)) # Raises TypeError
# print(int([])) # Raises TypeError
# print(int([1, 2])) # Raises TypeError
print(sys.getsizeof(int("9"*1000))) # Size of a very large integer created from string
print(int("9"*1000) + 1) # Addition with a very large integer created from string
print(int("9"*1000) * 2) # Multiplication with a very large integer created from string
print(int("9"*1000) // 3) # Floor division with a very large integer created from string

#### 12. Common Pitfalls

##### 12.1 Confusing `/` and `//`
```python
print(5 / 2) # 2.5 float
print(5 // 2) # 2 int
```

##### 12.2 Expecting fixed-size integers (Python does not overflow)
```python
print(2**200) #1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376
```

#### 13. Advance Concept:- Big Integer Mathematics

<details>
<summary>13. Advance Concept:- Big Integer Mathematics</summary>

Python’s `int` supports:
- exact big integer arithmetic  
- modular arithmetic  
- number-theoretic functions via libraries like `math` and `sympy`

Examples:
```python
pow(a, b, mod)  # fast modular exponentiation
```

---

##### Summary

- Python `int` is **arbitrary precision**, immutable, and extremely flexible.  
- Implemented in C using dynamic arrays of machine words.  
- Supports caching, bitwise arithmetic, type widening, and conversion.  
- Much more powerful and safer than fixed-size integers in compiled languages.

---

</details>


#### 14. Advance Concept:- Understanding Performance of Integer Operations in Python

<details>
<summary>14. Advance Concept:- Understanding Performance of Integer Operations in Python</summary>summary

Python's `int` is very powerful because it supports **arbitrary precision**—integers can grow to any size.  
However, performance differs between **small** and **large** integers because of how they are stored and processed internally.

---

##### 1. Small integers: Very fast due to caching

- Python pre-allocates and stores (“caches”) all integers in the range **−5 to 256**.
- These integers are created once at startup and **reused** throughout the program.
- Any time you create an integer in this range, Python does **not** allocate new memory.

Example:
```python
a = 100
b = 100
a is b     # True — both refer to the same cached object
```

**Why this is fast:**
- No memory allocation.
- No object creation.
- Python simply returns a reference to the cached integer.

This makes operations on small integers extremely efficient.

---

##### 2. Large integers: Slower operations (O(n), O(n²), sometimes O(n log n))

When integers get large (hundreds or thousands of digits):

- They no longer fit in a single machine word.
- Python must store them as **arrays of digits** (base 2³⁰ or 2¹⁵ chunks internally).
- Arithmetic must operate on **multiple chunks**, not one CPU instruction.

#### Advance Concept:- Complexity overview

| Operation | Time complexity | Reason |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Addition, subtraction | **O(n)** | Must process all “digits” of large numbers |
| Comparison | **O(n)** | Must compare digit-by-digit from most significant end |
| Multiplication | **O(n²)** for normal method | Every digit interacts with every digit |
| Multiplication (optimized) | **O(n log n)** with better algorithms | Python switches for large values |

Where:
- **n = number of internal digits**, not decimal digits.

Thus, very large integers behave like big sequences, not like primitive machine integers.

---

#### Advance Concept:- Multiplication uses optimized algorithms internally

Python uses different multiplication algorithms depending on the size of the integers.

##### a) Karatsuba algorithm (for medium-sized numbers)

- Faster than the standard grade-school multiplication.
- Complexity: **O(n^1.585)**  
- Used when integers have around **20–70 digits** (range varies).

Karatsuba divides numbers into parts and reduces the total multiplications needed.

##### b) FFT-based multiplication (for extremely large numbers)

When numbers become extremely large (thousands of digits), Python uses algorithms based on:

- **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**
- Schönhage–Strassen algorithm  
- (Newer versions of Python may use Fürer-like algorithms)

Complexity: approximately **O(n log n)** or better.

These advanced algorithms treat multiplication like polynomial convolution using FFT.

---
</details>

#### Advance Concept:- Internal Representation (CPython)

CPython stores integers using a structure:

```
PyLongObject:
    - reference count
    - type information
    - number of "digits" in base 2^30 or 2^15 (depending on build)
```

Key notes:
- “digits” are base-2³⁰ chunks (on 64-bit systems).
- Large integers use multiple digits.
- Thus, computing with huge numbers is slower but exact (no overflow).

---



---





#### Summary of small versus large integer usage in Python

- **Small integers** are extremely fast because Python reuses them from a cache.
- **Large integers** require more memory and multi-chunk operations, leading to slower performance.
- Python automatically chooses optimal multiplication algorithms depending on size:
  - Standard or Karatsuba for mid-sized numbers  
  - FFT-based algorithms for huge numbers  

This combination allows Python to support massive integers while still keeping performance as efficient as possible.

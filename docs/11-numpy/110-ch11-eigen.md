## About this chapter

Eigen decomposition takes a single square matrix and rewrites it as three
simpler pieces multiplied together — a rotation, a scaling, and a reversal
of that same rotation. That might sound abstract, but it's one of the most
useful ideas in applied linear algebra: it's the mathematical foundation
behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a large part of how Singular
Value Decomposition works, and a common tool for analysing the stability
of systems in engineering and physics.

This writeup gives both the theory and implementation of eigen decomposition.



So the equations
$A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}$ and $A = Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$ 

aren't just symbols on
a page, but things you can compute and verify for yourself in a few lines
of code.

## 1. The Core Concept

Previously, we established that if:

- $A$ is a square matrix
- $\vec{v}$ is a non-zero vector
- $\lambda$ is a scalar

then:

$$A\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$$

### Interpretation

- The matrix $A$ acts on vector $\vec{v}$
- The result is a **scaled version of the same vector**

This means:

- The **direction remains unchanged**
- Only the **magnitude changes**, by a factor of $\lambda$.

**Beginner tip:** this is precisely what makes $\vec{v}$ special — for
*almost any* vector, multiplying it by a matrix $A$ changes its direction
as well as its length. An eigenvector is one of the rare vectors (for a
given matrix) where the direction is left completely untouched.

---

### Cases of Eigenvalues

| Condition | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| $\lambda = 1$ | Vector remains unchanged |
| $\lambda > 1$ | Vector is stretched |
| $0 < \lambda < 1$ | Vector is compressed |
| $\lambda < 0$ | Direction is reversed |

## 2. The Logic Behind Decomposition

Why do we decompose a matrix?

The logic is similar to how a machine works by taking it apart into its
components. It is just like breaking a machine into parts to understand
it.

**A little more context on *why* this is worth doing:** once a matrix is
broken into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, many operations that are
difficult or slow on the original matrix become dramatically simpler on
the decomposed pieces — for example, raising a matrix to a large power, or
understanding how a system behaves after many repeated transformations.
This is also the mathematical basis for **Principal Component Analysis
(PCA)**, a widely used technique for reducing the number of variables in a
dataset while keeping as much meaningful information as possible.

---

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

For a matrix $A$ of dimensions $n \times n$:

- Suppose the eigenvalues are:
  $$\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_n$$
- And the corresponding eigenvectors are:
  $$\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}, \dots, \vec{v_n}$$

---

### Step 2: Construct Matrix $Q$

We can arrange the eigenvectors as columns into a matrix $Q$:

$$Q = [\vec{v_1} \quad \vec{v_2} \quad \dots \quad \vec{v_n}]$$

**Columns are eigenvectors.**

---

### Step 3: Construct Diagonal Matrix $\Lambda$

Next, we arrange the eigenvalues into a diagonal matrix $\Lambda$
(the capital Greek letter "lambda"):

$$\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & \lambda_n \end{bmatrix}$$

---

### Step 4: Key Equation

Using the definition $A\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$, we write a combined
matrix equation for all eigenvalues simultaneously:

$$AQ = Q\Lambda$$

If $Q$ is invertible:

$$A = Q \Lambda Q^{-1}$$

---

### Interpretation

Eigen decomposition represents:

```text
A = Rotation → Scaling → Rotation back
```

**In plain terms:** $Q^{-1}$ first rotates (or more precisely, changes the
coordinate system of) a vector into the special "eigenvector-aligned"
view; $\Lambda$ then simply stretches or shrinks each coordinate
independently (exactly the diagonal-matrix scaling from earlier in this
chapter); and $Q$ rotates the result back into the original coordinate
system. The net effect of doing all three, in order, is mathematically
identical to just applying $A$ directly — decomposition doesn't change
*what* the matrix does, only reveals *how* it does it.

## 3. Turning This Into NumPy Code

NumPy's `np.linalg.eig()` function computes a matrix's eigenvalues and
eigenvectors directly, so you don't need to work them out by hand. The
script below uses it to verify every equation covered above, with the same
matrix throughout.

```python
import numpy as np

# ---------------------------------------------------
# Step 1 - Define a square matrix A to decompose.
# ---------------------------------------------------
A = np.array([
    [2, 1],
    [1, 2]
])
print("Matrix A:\n", A)


# ---------------------------------------------------
# Step 2 - Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using NumPy.
# np.linalg.eig() returns two things:
#   eigenvalues  -> a 1D array, e.g. [lambda1, lambda2]
#   eigenvectors -> a 2D array whose COLUMNS are the eigenvectors,
#                   in the same order as the eigenvalues
# This eigenvectors array IS the matrix Q from the theory above.
# ---------------------------------------------------
eigenvalues, Q = np.linalg.eig(A)

print("\nEigenvalues (lambda1, lambda2):", eigenvalues)
print("\nEigenvector matrix Q (columns are eigenvectors):\n", Q)


# ---------------------------------------------------
# Step 3 - Verify A @ v = lambda * v for ONE eigenvector, to confirm
# what "eigenvector" and "eigenvalue" actually mean in practice.
# ---------------------------------------------------
v1 = Q[:, 0]          # the FIRST column of Q -> the first eigenvector
lambda1 = eigenvalues[0]

left_side = A @ v1            # A applied to the eigenvector
right_side = lambda1 * v1     # the eigenvector, simply scaled by lambda1

print("\nA @ v1:       ", left_side)
print("lambda1 * v1: ", right_side)
print("Equal (within floating-point rounding)?", np.allclose(left_side, right_side))
# Output: True -- confirming A @ v1 really does equal lambda1 * v1,
# exactly as the definition A*v = lambda*v promised.


# ---------------------------------------------------
# Step 4 - Build the diagonal matrix Lambda from the eigenvalues.
# np.diag() turns the flat list of eigenvalues into the diagonal
# matrix described in Step 3 of the theory above.
# ---------------------------------------------------
Lambda = np.diag(eigenvalues)
print("\nDiagonal matrix Lambda:\n", Lambda)


# ---------------------------------------------------
# Step 5 - Reconstruct A from Q, Lambda, and the inverse of Q,
# to verify the key equation: A = Q @ Lambda @ Q_inverse
# ---------------------------------------------------
Q_inverse = np.linalg.inv(Q)
A_reconstructed = Q @ Lambda @ Q_inverse

print("\nOriginal A:\n", A)
print("\nReconstructed A = Q @ Lambda @ Q_inverse:\n", A_reconstructed)
print("\nMatches original A (within floating-point rounding)?",
      np.allclose(A, A_reconstructed))
# Output: True -- the decomposition, multiplied back together,
# genuinely reproduces the original matrix.
```

**Expected output (values may show tiny floating-point differences, e.g.
`1.9999999999999998` instead of exactly `2`):**

```
Matrix A:
 [[2 1]
 [1 2]]

Eigenvalues (lambda1, lambda2): [3. 1.]

Eigenvector matrix Q (columns are eigenvectors):
 [[ 0.70710678 -0.70710678]
 [ 0.70710678  0.70710678]]

A @ v1:        [2.12132034 2.12132034]
lambda1 * v1:  [2.12132034 2.12132034]
Equal (within floating-point rounding)? True

Diagonal matrix Lambda:
 [[3. 0.]
 [0. 1.]]

Original A:
 [[2 1]
 [1 2]]

Reconstructed A = Q @ Lambda @ Q_inverse:
 [[2. 1.]
 [1. 2.]]

Matches original A (within floating-point rounding)? True
```

**Beginner tip:** always compare floating-point results with
`np.allclose()` rather than `==`. Because of how computers store decimal
numbers internally, a value that is *mathematically* exactly `2` might
actually be stored as `1.9999999999999998` after a chain of
multiplications and inversions — `np.allclose()` checks for equality
*within a small, sensible tolerance*, rather than demanding bit-for-bit
exactness.

## Summary

| Concept | Key takeaway |
| --- | --- |
| $A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}$ | An eigenvector's *direction* is unchanged by $A$; only its length changes, by a factor of $\lambda$ |
| $Q$ | A matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $A$ |
| $\Lambda$ | A diagonal matrix holding all of $A$'s eigenvalues |
| $A = Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$ | The full decomposition: rotate into eigenvector space, scale, rotate back |
| `np.linalg.eig(A)` | NumPy's direct tool for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, without solving by hand |
| Why it matters | Foundational to PCA, closely related to SVD, and simplifies many repeated-transformation problems |

## Follow-up questions for practice

*(These are additional, optional questions for self-testing.)*

1. Using the script above, verify $A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}$ for the
   **second** eigenvector (`Q[:, 1]` and `eigenvalues[1]`) instead of the
   first. Does `np.allclose()` still confirm a match?
2. What eigenvalues would you expect for a pure scaling matrix like
   `np.array([[4, 0], [0, 4]])`? Run `np.linalg.eig()` on it and check
   your prediction — does this match the "Cases of Eigenvalues" table
   above?
3. Try running `np.linalg.eig()` on a matrix that represents a 90-degree
   rotation, `np.array([[0, -1], [1, 0]])`. What do you notice about the
   eigenvalues? (Hint: a pure rotation has no real direction that stays
   unchanged — see if the result gives you a clue why.)
4. Using `np.diag()` and the reconstructed-matrix approach from Step 5,
   what would happen if you deliberately used the *wrong* order of columns
   in `Q` (e.g. swapped `Q[:, 0]` and `Q[:, 1]`) without also swapping the
   matching eigenvalues in `Lambda`? Would the reconstruction still work?
   Why or why not?

# Discussion: Testing User Validation with pytest.raises()

## Overview

This example demonstrates how exceptions can be used to enforce validation rules and how those exceptions can be tested using `pytest.raises()`.

The application code contains a small user-registration function called `create_user()`. Before creating a user record, the function validates the supplied information and rejects invalid input by raising exceptions.

Although the example is intentionally small, it mirrors patterns frequently found in production systems, including:

-   Input validation
-   Business-rule enforcement
-   Defensive programming
-   Exception-based error handling
-   Fail-fast design

The example was specifically chosen because it provides several opportunities to demonstrate different ways of testing exceptions with pytest.

## What the Script Does

The purpose of the script is to create a user record.

The function accepts three pieces of information:

```python
username
age
email
```

Before returning a user record, the function verifies that:

1.  A username has been provided.
2.  The user is at least 13 years old.
3.  The email address appears to be valid.

If any of these requirements are violated, the function immediately raises a `ValueError`.

Only valid data is allowed through.



## Need for validation in the Script

Real-world applications constantly receive input from users and external systems.

Examples include:

-   Registration forms
-   Login pages
-   Configuration files
-   APIs
-   Databases

Input cannot be trusted automatically.

Users make mistakes.

Applications therefore validate incoming information before processing it.

This script demonstrates that principle in a simple and approachable form.

----------

## How the Script Works

### Username Validation

```python
if not username:
    raise ValueError("Username cannot be empty")
```

The first validation checks whether a username exists.

Examples that fail:

```python
create_user("", 20, "alice@example.com")
```

```python
create_user(None, 20, "alice@example.com")
```

The function raises an exception because an empty username is not acceptable.

----------

### Age Validation

```python
if age < 13:
    raise ValueError(
        "User must be at least 13 years old"
    )
```

This validation enforces a business rule.

The application has decided that users younger than 13 cannot register.

Example:

```python
create_user("alice", 10, "alice@example.com")
```

Result:

```python
ValueError:
User must be at least 13 years old
```

----------

### Email Validation

```python
if not re.match(
    r"^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$",
    email
):
    raise ValueError(
        "Invalid email address"
    )
```

This validation uses a regular expression.

The expression checks that the email roughly follows this pattern:

```python
name@example.com
```

The validation is intentionally simple.

Its purpose is to demonstrate validation logic rather than provide industrial-strength email verification.

----------

### Successful Completion

If all validation checks pass, the function returns a dictionary.

Example:

```python
user = create_user(
    "alice",
    20,
    "alice@example.com"
)
```

Result:

```python
{
    "username": "alice",
    "age": 20,
    "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

----------

## Why ValueError Is Used

The function raises `ValueError` because the values supplied by the caller are unacceptable.

The arguments themselves are valid parameters.

The problem lies in their contents.

Examples:

```python
""
```

```python
10
```

```python
"not-an-email"
```

This is exactly the situation for which `ValueError` was designed.

----------

## Learning Points

### Input Validation

The script demonstrates how applications verify incoming data before using it.

Validation is one of the most common tasks in software development.

----------

### Defensive Programming

The function assumes that callers may provide invalid data.

Instead of trusting its inputs, it verifies them.

This style is known as `defensive programming`.

----------

### Raising Exceptions

The script shows how exceptions communicate errors.

```python
raise ValueError(...)
```

Rather than returning an error code, the function raises an exception containing meaningful information.

----------

### Fail-Fast Design

Notice that validation stops as soon as a problem is discovered.

For example:

```python
create_user("", 10, "bad-email")
```

The username validation fails first.

The remaining validations never execute.

This is known as fail-fast behavior.

----------

### Business Rules

 - The age requirement is not a Python rule.
 - It is a business rule defined by the application.
 - Many production systems contain hundreds of similar rules.

----------

### Regular Expressions

The script introduces practical regex usage.

Regular expressions are widely used for:

-   Validation
-   Searching
-   Parsing
-   Data extraction
-   Data cleaning

----------

## Why This Example Is Good for `pytest.raises()`

The function contains multiple independent failure paths.

Each path can be tested separately.

Examples include:

-   Empty username
-   Underage user
-   Invalid email address

This allows us to demonstrate several pytest features.

----------

## Testing Exception Occurrence

```python
with pytest.raises(ValueError):
    create_user("", 20, "alice@example.com")
```

This verifies that an exception is raised.

----------

## Testing Exception Messages

```python
with pytest.raises(
    ValueError,
    match="Username cannot be empty"
):
    create_user("", 20, "alice@example.com")
```

This verifies both the exception type and message.

----------

## Using excinfo

```python
with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
    create_user("alice", 10, "alice@example.com")
```

The captured exception can then be inspected.

```python
assert excinfo.type is ValueError
```

```python
assert "13 years old" in str(excinfo.value)
```

----------

## Functional Form

Pytest also supports a functional style.

```python
pytest.raises(
    ValueError,
    create_user,
    "",
    20,
    "alice@example.com"
)
```

Although less common today, readers may encounter this form in older codebases.

----------

## Key Takeaways

This small example demonstrates several important software engineering concepts:

-   Input validation
-   Defensive programming
-   Exception handling
-   Fail-fast design
-   Business-rule enforcement
-   Regular-expression matching
-   Unit testing with pytest

More importantly, it shows how `pytest.raises()` can be used to verify that code behaves correctly when invalid input is encountered.

# Real-World Python: Practical Uses for Standard Library Modules
Below are practical, real-world examples of how to use the specialized data structures and tools covered in Chapter 17. 

---

## 1. The `collections` Module

### 1.1 `Counter`: Log File Analysis
**Usage:** Imagine you are a server administrator. You have a text file containing thousands of server log entries, and you need to quickly find the top 3 most common error codes to see what is breaking the most.
```python
from collections import Counter

# Simulated raw log data (one entry per line)
log_data = """
Error 404: Page not found
Error 500: Internal server error
Error 200: OK
Error 404: Page not found
Error 403: Forbidden
Error 500: Internal server error
Error 404: Page not found
"""

# Extract just the error codes and count them
error_codes = [line.split()[1] for line in log_data.strip().split('\n')]
counts = Counter(error_codes)

print("Top 3 Issues:")
for code, count in counts.most_common(3):
    print(f"  {code}: occurred {count} times")
```
### Output
```python
Top 3 Issues:
  404:: occurred 3 times
  500:: occurred 2 times
  200:: occurred 1 times
```
**Explanation:** We use a simple list comprehension to extract just the numbers (e.g., "404") from each line. Then, `Counter` does all the heavy lifting. The `.most_common(3)` method instantly grabs the top three issues, saving us from writing complex sorting logic.

### 1.2 `deque`: Terminal Command History
**Usage:** When building a command-line application (like a terminal or an interactive text game), you want to store the user's recent commands so they can press the "Up" arrow to see what they just typed. You also want to limit this memory so it doesn't grow infinitely.
```python
from collections import deque

# Create a deque that holds a maximum of 3 items
command_history = deque(maxlen=3)

# Simulate a user typing commands
commands_typed = ["ls", "cd /home", "pwd", "mkdir new_folder", "ls -l"]

for cmd in commands_typed:
    command_history.append(cmd)
    print(f"Current History: {list(command_history)}")
```
### Output

```python
Current History: ['ls']
Current History: ['ls', 'cd /home']
Current History: ['ls', 'cd /home', 'pwd']
Current History: ['cd /home', 'pwd', 'mkdir new_folder']
Current History: ['pwd', 'mkdir new_folder', 'ls -l']
```

**Explanation:** By setting `maxlen=3`, the `deque` automatically discards the oldest item the moment a 4th item is added. A standard Python list cannot do this automatically; you would have to write `if-else` logic to check the length and manually delete items.

### 1.3 `defaultdict`: Grouping Grades by Letter
**Usage:** A teacher has a list of student scores and needs to group all the students who got an 'A', 'B', or 'C' together. With a normal dictionary, checking if 'A' exists and creating a list for it is tedious.
```python
from collections import defaultdict

students_scores = [
    ("Alice", "A"), ("Bob", "B"), ("Charlie", "A"), ("David", "C"), ("Eve", "B")
]

# Automatically creates an empty list for any new grade letter
grade_book = defaultdict(list)

for name, grade in students_scores:
    grade_book[grade].append(name) # No KeyError!

print(dict(grade_book))
```
### Output

```python
{'A': ['Alice', 'Charlie'], 'B': ['Bob', 'Eve'], 'C': ['David']}
```

**Explanation:** Because we used `defaultdict(list)`, the first time Python sees the grade "A", it realizes the key doesn't exist. Instead of crashing with a `KeyError`, it silently creates an empty list `[]` for "A", and then appends "Alice" to it.

### 1.4 `OrderedDict`: Most Recently Used (MRU) Cache
**Usage:** Web browsers and apps keep a "Recently Viewed" list. When you view an old item again, it gets pulled out of the middle of the list and moved to the very end.
```python
from collections import OrderedDict

# Simulate viewing pages in order
viewed_pages = OrderedDict([
    ("Home", 1), ("About", 2), ("Contact", 3)
])

print("Initial:", list(viewed_pages.keys()))

# User clicks "About" again
viewed_pages.move_to_end("About")

print("After viewing About again:", list(viewed_pages.keys()))
```

### Output

```python
Initial: ['Home', 'About', 'Contact']
After viewing About again: ['Home', 'Contact', 'About']
```

**Explanation:** A modern standard `dict` remembers insertion order, but it doesn't have tools to manipulate that order. `OrderedDict` gives us the `move_to_end()` method, which perfectly simulates an MRU list by moving "About" to the back of the line.

### 1.5 `namedtuple`: Parsing CSV Data
**Usage:** You read a line of data from a comma-separated file. Instead of accessing `row[2]` and hoping it's the right column, you use a `namedtuple` to make your code self-documenting.
```python
from  collections  import  namedtuple

# namedtuple() creates a tuple-like class.
# The first argument "Employee" is the name of the class being created.
# The second argument is a list of field names (attributes).
#
# The created class will have these fields:
# id
# name
# department
# salary
#
# Employee is now a new class which behaves like a tuple
# but allows accessing values using names.
Employee  =  namedtuple("Employee", ["id", "name", "department", "salary"])

# Suppose this data has come from a CSV file.
# A CSV file stores data as comma-separated text.
#
# Current value:
# "101,Sarah,Engineering,85000"
#
# The order of values matches the order of fields in Employee:
#
# id -> 101
# name -> Sarah
# department -> Engineering
# salary -> 85000
csv_row  =  "101,Sarah,Engineering,85000"

# split(',') breaks the string into a list.
#
# Before:

# "101,Sarah,Engineering,85000"
#
# After:
# ['101', 'Sarah', 'Engineering', '85000']
# The * operator unpacks this list.
# So:
# Employee(*csv_row.split(','))
# becomes:
# Employee(
# '101',
# 'Sarah',
# 'Engineering',
# '85000'
# )
#
# A new Employee object is created.
emp  =  Employee(*csv_row.split(','))

# Accessing data using field names.
# Without namedtuple we would need indexes:
# csv_row.split(',')[1] -> name
# csv_row.split(',')[2] -> department
#
# Namedtuple makes the code clearer:
# emp.name
# emp.department
print(f"Name: {emp.name} | Dept: {emp.department}")
```
### Output

```python
Name: Sarah | Dept: Engineering
```

**Explanation:** The `*csv_row.split(',')` unpacks the 4 strings directly into the `Employee` constructor. Now, you have a lightweight object where you can access data using `.name` and `.salary` instead of trying to remember index numbers.

### 1.6 `ChainMap`: Application Configuration
**Usage:** Apps have default settings, user settings, and command-line arguments. If a user provides a setting, it should override the default. `ChainMap` lets you layer these without merging them.
```python
from  collections  import  ChainMap
# Create a dictionary containing default settings.
# These values will be used when the user has not
# provided their own preference.

defaults  = {
"theme": "light",
"volume": 50,
"difficulty": "normal"
}

# Create another dictionary containing user-specific settings.
# User settings should have higher priority than defaults.
# Here the user has changed only the theme.

user_prefs  = {
"theme": "dark"
}

# ChainMap combines multiple dictionaries into one view.
# IMPORTANT:
# ChainMap does not create a new dictionary.
# It keeps the original dictionaries and searches them in order.
# Search order:
# 1. user_prefs (checked first)
# 2. defaults (checked if not found above)
# Therefore, if both dictionaries have the same key,
# the value from user_prefs is used.

config  =  ChainMap(
user_prefs,
defaults
)

# Accessing "theme":
# Python first looks in user_prefs.
# It finds:
# user_prefs["theme"] = "dark"
# So this value is returned.
print(f"Theme: {config['theme']}")
# Accessing "volume":
# Python first looks in user_prefs.
# "volume" is not present there.
# Then it checks defaults:
# defaults["volume"] = 50
# So the default value is returned.
print(f"Volume: {config['volume']}")
```

```output
Theme: dark
Volume: 50
```

**Explanation:** `ChainMap` doesn't combine the dictionaries into a new one (which wastes memory). It creates a "view" that searches `user_prefs` first. If the key isn't there, it searches `defaults`. This is exactly how professional config parsers work.

## 2. The `heapq` Module

### Priority Task Manager
**Usage:** You are building a to-do list application. Tasks have a priority number (1 is urgent, 5 is low). You want to always process the most urgent task next, regardless of when it was added.
```python
import  heapq
# Create an empty list that will be used as a heap.
# Python's heapq module uses a normal list to store the heap.
# In a heap:- the smallest item is always kept at the top
# Here each item will be a tuple: (priority_number, task_description)
# The first value decides the priority.
# Smaller priority number = higher priority.
tasks  = []

# Add tasks to the heap.
# heappush() inserts an item and automatically rearranges
# the list so that the heap property is maintained.
# Items are tuples: (priority, description)
# Since priority is the first item in the tuple,
# heapq compares priority numbers.
# Priority 1 will come before Priority 2,
# and Priority 2 will come before Priority 3.

heapq.heappush(tasks, (3, "Organize desk")) # Add a task with priority 3
heapq.heappush(tasks, (1, "Fix critical bug")) #Add a task with priority 1
heapq.heappush(tasks, (2, "Reply to client email")) # Add a task with priority 2
print("Processing tasks in order of priority:") # Display heading
# Process tasks until the heap becomes empty.
# heappop() removes and returns the smallest item from the heap.
#
# Since our tuples start with priority numbers,
# the task with the smallest priority number is removed first.
# Example:
# (1, "Fix critical bug") comes out first
# (2, "Reply to client email") comes next
# (3, "Organize desk") comes last
while  tasks:
    # Unpack the tuple returned by heappop()
    # priority gets the first value
    # task gets the second value
    priority, task  =  heapq.heappop(tasks)
    print(f"Priority {priority}: {task}")

# Output:
# Priority 1: Fix critical bug
# Priority 2: Reply to client email
# Priority 3: Organize desk
```
**Explanation:** We push tuples into a normal list. `heappush` automatically sorts them internally so the smallest number (highest priority) is always at index 0. `heappop` safely removes and returns that top priority item.

---

## 3. The `bisect` Module

Student Marks List

Usage: A teacher maintains a sorted list of student marks. When a new student's marks are received, the mark needs to be inserted at the correct position so that the list remains sorted. This makes it easy to display marks in ascending or descending order. bisect finds the correct insertion position quickly.
```python
import bisect

# List of student marks.
# IMPORTANT: The list must already be sorted for bisect to work.
marks = [40, 55, 70, 80, 95]

# New student's marks that we want to insert
# while keeping the list sorted.
new_marks = 65

# bisect_left() uses binary search to find the position
# where new_marks should be inserted.
#
# It only returns the index.
# It does not modify the list.
insert_index = bisect.bisect_left(marks, new_marks)

# insort() inserts the value at the correct position
# and keeps the list sorted.
bisect.insort(marks, new_marks)

print(f"Inserted at index {insert_index}")  # Output: Inserted at index 2
print("Updated marks:", marks)  # Output: Updated marks: [40, 55, 65, 70, 80, 95]
```
**Explanation:** `bisect_left` instantly calculates that 350 belongs at index 2. `insort` then physically inserts it at that exact spot. Doing this manually with a `for` loop and `.insert()` would be much slower for large leaderboards.

---

## 4. The `queue` Module

### 4.1 `Queue` (FIFO): Coffee Shop Orders
**Usage:** A barista takes orders one by one. The first order placed should be the first one served.
```python
import queue


# Create a Queue object.
# Queue follows FIFO rule:
# First In, First Out
# The item added first will be removed first.
# It is similar to a real-life queue:
# the first person standing in line is served first.
coffee_orders = queue.Queue()

# Add items to the queue using put().
# These orders are stored in the order they arrive:
# 1. Latte
# 2. Espresso
# 3. Cappuccino
coffee_orders.put("Latte")  # Add an item to the end of the queue.
coffee_orders.put("Espresso")  # Add an item to the end of the queue.
coffee_orders.put("Cappuccino")  # Add an item to the end of the queue.

print("Making:")
# Continue until the queue becomes empty.
# empty() checks whether there are no more items.
while not coffee_orders.empty():
    # get() removes and returns the first item in the queue.
    # Order of removal: Latte → Espresso → Cappuccino
    print(f"  - {coffee_orders.get()}")

# Output:
# Making:
#   - Latte
#   - Espresso
#   - Cappuccino
```
**Explanation:** `.put()` adds to the back of the line. `.get()` safely removes from the front. While a `deque` is faster for single-threaded code, `queue.Queue` is mandatory if you have multiple threads (e.g., one thread taking orders, another thread making coffee).

### 4.2 `LifoQueue` (LIFO): The "Undo" Button
**Usage:** In a text editor, when a user hits "Undo", you need to reverse the very last action they took, not the first one.
```python
import queue

# Create a LifoQueue object.
# LIFO means: Last In, First Out
# The most recent item added is removed first.
# It works like a stack of plates:
# the last plate placed on top is the first one removed.
action_history = queue.LifoQueue()

# Add user actions to the stack using put().
# Actions are stored in the order they happen
# 1. Typed 'Hello'
# 2. Typed ' World'
# 3. Deleted 'World'
#
# The last action is now at the top of the stack.
action_history.put("Typed 'Hello'")
action_history.put("Typed ' World'")
action_history.put("Deleted 'World'")

print("Undoing last action:")
# get() removes and returns the most recent action.
# Because this is a LifoQueue:
# Deleted 'World' is removed before Typed ' World' and Typed 'Hello'.
# This is the same idea used in
# Undo operations in text editors.
print(f"  Reversed: {action_history.get()}")  

# Output: Reversed: Deleted 'World'
```
**Explanation:** Because it's Last-In, First-Out, putting "Deleted 'World'" in last means it's the very first thing `.get()` pulls out, perfectly simulating an Undo stack.

### 4.3 `PriorityQueue`: Hospital Triage
**Usage:** Patients arrive at an ER, but they shouldn't be treated in the order they arrived. A patient with a heart attack (priority 1) must jump ahead of a patient with a scraped knee (priority 5).
```python
import queue

er = queue.PriorityQueue()

er.put((5, "Scraped Knee"))
er.put((1, "Heart Attack"))
er.put((3, "Broken Arm"))

print("Treating patients:")
while not er.empty():
    severity, condition = er.get()
    print(f"  Severity {severity}: {condition}")
```
**Explanation:** Identical in behavior to `heapq`, but `PriorityQueue` is wrapped in a thread-safe class, meaning if multiple nurses (threads) are calling `.get()` at the same time, no two nurses will accidentally grab the same patient.

---

## 5. The `enum` Module

### HTTP Status Codes
**Usage:** When building a web API, returning random numbers like `404` or `200` makes code hard to read. Enums allow you to use readable names that map to those standard numbers.
```python
from enum import Enum

# Create an Enum class for HTTP status codes.
# An Enum allows us to create meaningful names
# instead of using unexplained numbers.
# Without Enum:
#     200  → What does this mean?
#     404  → What does this mean?
# With Enum:
#     OK          → 200
#     NOT_FOUND   → 404
#     SERVER_ERROR → 500

class HttpStatus(Enum):
    # Each name is an enum member.
    # The assigned value is the actual HTTP status code.
    OK = 200
    NOT_FOUND = 404
    SERVER_ERROR = 500

# Function receives an HttpStatus value.
# It is clearer to pass: HttpStatus.OK instead of: 200
# because the meaning is obvious.
def send_response(status):
    # Compare the enum member.
    if status == HttpStatus.OK:
        print("Success! Sending data...")

    elif status == HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND:
        print("Error: Page does not exist.")


# Call the function using the readable enum name.
# Internally Python compares:
# HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.value which is: 404
send_response(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
# Output: Error: Page does not exist.
```
**Explanation:** `HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND` evaluates to `404`, but it makes the code instantly understandable to another developer. If you type `HttpStatus.NOT_FOUNT` by mistake, Python will immediately throw an error, preventing typos.

---

## 6. `dataclasses`

### E-Commerce Product Catalog
**Usage:** You are building an online store. You need an object to represent a product. Writing a full class with `__init__` and `__repr__` for every database record is tedious.
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

# @dataclass is a decorator that automatically adds
# useful methods to a class.
# It can automatically create methods such as:
# - __init__()  → creates objects
# - __repr__()  → gives a readable print output
# - __eq__()    → compares objects
# We do not need to write these methods manually.
@dataclass
class Product:
    # These are dataclass fields.
    # Type hints tell us what type of data we expect to store.
    # They are suggestions, not strict rules.
    name: str
    price: float

    # A normal default value.
    # If no value for attribute in_stock is provided while creating an object, 
    # in_stock will be True.
    in_stock: bool = True

    # A list is a mutable object. We should not write:
    # tags: list = []
    # because all objects could accidentally share the same list.
    # default_factory=list means:
    # create a new empty list for every Product object.
    tags: list = field(default_factory=list)

# Create a Product object.
# The dataclass automatically creates the constructor:
# Product(name, price, in_stock, tags)
# Here:
# name = "Laptop"
# price = 999.99
# tags = ["electronics", "computer"]
# in_stock is not given, so it uses the default True.
p1 = Product("Laptop", 999.99, tags=["electronics", "computer"])


# Another Product object.
# Here we provide:
# in_stock=False
# so the default value True is replaced.
p2 = Product("Desk", 150.00, in_stock=False)

# Printing a dataclass object.
# Because of the automatically created __repr__(),
# Python displays the object with field names and values.
# Example:
# Product(name='Laptop', price=999.99, ...)
print(p1)  
# Output: Product(name='Laptop', price=999.99, in_stock=True, tags=['electronics', 'computer'])

# Accessing fields using attribute names.
# p1.name gives:
# "Laptop"
# p1.tags gives: ["electronics", "computer"]
print(f"Tags for {p1.name}: {p1.tags}")
# Output: Tags for Laptop: ['electronics', 'computer']
```
**Explanation:** The `@dataclass` decorator saves us from writing `def __init__(self, name, price...` etc. It auto-generates the setup and the string representation. `field(default_factory=list)` safely ensures `p1` and `p2` don't accidentally share the same tags list.

---

## 7. `functools` Module

### 7.1 `lru_cache`: Simulating a Slow Database
**Usage:** Fetching data from a database over a network takes time. If multiple parts of your program ask for "User #42"'s profile, you don't want to query the database three times.
```python
from functools import lru_cache
import time

# lru_cache is a decorator that stores the results returned by a function.
# This technique is called memoization.
# If the same function is called again with the same # arguments, 
# Python returns the saved result instead of running the function again.
# This is useful for expensive operations such as:
# - database queries
# - API calls
# - complex calculations
#
# maxsize=None means: keep all cached results.
# (No limit on number of stored results.)
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_user_from_db(user_id):
    # This line runs only when the result is not
    # already stored in the cache.
    # If the same user_id is requested again,
    # this function body will be skipped.
    print(f"  -> Querying database for User {user_id}...")

    # Simulate a slow operation.
    # In real life this could be:
    # - reading from a database
    # - calling a web service
    # We wait for 1 second to demonstrate
    # the benefit of caching.
    time.sleep(1)

    # Return the user information.
    # lru_cache stores this returned value
    # along with the input argument (user_id).
    return {
        "id": user_id,
        "name": "Alice"
    }

# Request the same user multiple times.
print("Fetching user 42:")

# First call:
# - user_id = 42 is not in cache
# - function executes
# - database query happens
# - result is stored in cache
print(get_user_from_db(42))
# Output:
# Fetching user 42:
#  -> Querying database for User 42...
# {'id': 42, 'name': 'Alice'}

# Second call:
# - user_id = 42 already exists in cache
# - function does NOT execute again
# - saved result is returned immediately
print(get_user_from_db(42))
# Output:
# {'id': 42, 'name': 'Alice'}
# Note Fetching user 42: is printed only once, because the function body is skipped for subsequent calls with the same argument.


# Third call:
# Same as above.
# No database query.
# Result comes from cache.
print(get_user_from_db(42))
# Output:
# {'id': 42, 'name': 'Alice'}
# Note Fetching user 42: is printed only once, because the function body is skipped for subsequent calls with the same argument.
```
**Explanation:** The first call takes 1 second. The next two calls take 0 seconds because `lru_cache` remembers the output for ID 42. In real life, this simple decorator can speed up applications by thousands of percent.

### 7.2 `partial`: Pre-filling Log Levels
**Usage:** You have a logging function that takes a message and a severity level. You find yourself typing `log("message", "ERROR")` over and over. You can use `partial` to create a dedicated `log_error` function.
```python
from functools import partial

# log_message() is a normal function that accepts two arguments:
    # message → the text we want to display
    # level   → the type/importance of the message
# Example:
# log_message("Server started", "INFO")
def log_message(message, level):
    # upper() converts the level text to uppercase.
    # Example: "error" becomes "ERROR"
    print(f"[{level.upper()}] {message}")

# partial() creates a new function from an existing function.
# Here we fix (pre-fill) the value of:
# level = "ERROR"
# The original function:
# log_message(message, level)
# becomes:
# log_error(message)
# because the level is already decided.
# partial() does not call the function immediately.
# It creates a new function object.
log_error = partial(log_message, level="ERROR")

# Now we only need to provide the remaining argument:
# message
# Internally this becomes:
# log_message("Database connection failed!", "ERROR")
log_error("Database connection failed!")  # Output: [ERROR] Database connection failed!

# Same idea:
# level is automatically "ERROR"
# only the message changes.
log_error("File not found!")  # Output: [ERROR] File not found!
```
**Explanation:** `partial` takes a function and "freezes" some of its arguments. `log_error` is now a brand new function that only requires one argument (`message`), automatically passing `"ERROR"` to the background.

### 7.3 `reduce`: Calculating Shopping Cart Total
**Usage:** You have a list of dictionary items in a shopping cart, and you need to calculate the grand total.
```python
from functools import reduce

cart = [
    {"item": "Book", "price": 15.99},
    {"item": "Pen", "price": 2.50},
    {"item": "Notebook", "price": 5.00}
]

total = reduce(lambda acc, item: acc + item["price"], cart, 0)

print(f"Grand Total: ${total:.2f}")
```
**Explanation:** `reduce` starts with `0` (the third argument). It takes the first item's price and adds it to 0. It then takes that result, adds the second item's price, and so on, collapsing the whole list into one single float value.

---

## 8. `itertools` Module

### 8.1 `chain`: Flattening 2D Data
**Usage:** You have a matrix (a list of lists) or multiple separate data streams, and you just want to loop through all the numbers in one continuous loop without creating a massive new list in memory.
```python
from itertools import chain
# A 2-dimensional list (list of lists).
# Each inner list represents a row.
# Think of it like a table:
# Row 1:  1  2  3
# Row 2:  4  5  6
# Row 3:  7  8  9
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# chain.from_iterable() combines multiple iterables into one sequence.
# Here the iterable is: matrix
# which contains:
# [1,2,3]
# [4,5,6]
# [7,8,9]
# It takes items from the first list, then the second list, then the third list.
# Resulting sequence:
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
# It does not create a new list.
# It returns an iterator that gives values one by one.
for num in chain.from_iterable(matrix):
    # Each value produced by the iterator is printed.
    # end=" " keeps the output on the same line with spaces between numbers.
    print(num, end=" ")

# Output:
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Explanation:** `chain.from_iterable` takes an iterable of iterables (a list of lists) and links them together. It yields `1, 2, 3, 4...` one by one. It is incredibly memory efficient because it never actually creates the flattened list in RAM.

### 8.2 `groupby`: Grouping Transactions by Month
**Usage:** You have a list of bank transactions sorted by date. You want to print a summary showing all transactions that happened in January, then February, etc.
```python
from itertools import groupby
# groupby() groups consecutive items that have the same key.
# IMPORTANT: 
# The data should be sorted by the same value that we are using for grouping.
# Here we want to group by month, so all transactions of the same month should be together.
transactions = [
    ("Jan", "Coffee"),
    ("Jan", "Gas"),
    ("Feb", "Rent"),
    ("Feb", "Groceries"),
    ("Mar", "Electricity")
]

# groupby() returns pairs:
# (key, group_iterator)
# key:
#     The value used for grouping.
# items:
#     An iterator containing all items belonging to that group.
# The lambda function:
# lambda t: t[0]
# means:
# take each transaction tuple and use
# its first element (month) as the key.
# Example:
# ("Jan", "Coffee") → "Jan"
# ("Feb", "Rent")   → "Feb"
#
for month, items in groupby(transactions, key=lambda t: t[0]):
    # items is an iterator containing transactions of the current month.
    # Example:
    # For January:
    # [
    #   ("Jan", "Coffee"),
    #   ("Jan", "Gas")
    # ]
    # The list comprehension extracts only
    # the expense names (second value).
    # item[1] gives:
    # Coffee
    # Gas
    print(f"{month}: {[item[1] for item in items]}")

# Output:
# Jan: ['Coffee', 'Gas']
# Feb: ['Rent', 'Groceries']
# Mar: ['Electricity']
```
**Explanation:** The `key` function tells `groupby` to look at index 0 (the month). It groups consecutive identical months together, allowing us to easily print a clean summary without writing complex `if/else` state-tracking logic.

### 8.3 `product`: Combination Lock Generator
**Usage:** You are building a security tool or a puzzle game, and you need to generate every possible combination of a 2-dial lock, where each dial has numbers 0 through 2.
```python
from itertools import product

dials = [0, 1, 2]

# Generate all possible (dial1, dial2) combinations
combinations = list(product(dials, repeat=2))

print(f"Total combinations: {len(combinations)}")
for combo in combinations:
    print(combo, end=" ")
```
**Explanation:** `product` acts like a set of nested `for` loops. `repeat=2` tells it to combine the `dials` list with itself twice. It perfectly simulates Cartesian math (e.g., $3 \times 3 = 9$ combinations).

### 8.4 `permutations`: Seating Arrangements
**Usage:** You have 3 friends coming to dinner, but your table only has 3 distinct chairs. You want to know all the possible ways they can sit down.
```python
from itertools import permutations
# A list of people who need to be arranged.
# We want to find all possible seating orders for these friends.
friends = [
    "Alice",
    "Bob",
    "Charlie"
]

# permutations() creates all possible arrangements of the given items.
# Important: # In permutations, the order matters.
# Example: ("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie") is different from: ("Bob", "Alice", "Charlie")
# because the seating order has changed.
# permutations() returns an iterator, so we convert it to a list to store all results.
seating_charts = list(permutations(friends))


# The number of possible arrangements is the number of items in the list.
# For 3 people:→ 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 arrangements
# This is called 3 factorial (3!).
print(f"Total seating arrangements: {len(seating_charts)}")

# Loop through every possible arrangement.
# Each arrangement is a tuple representing one possible seating order.
# Example: ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie')
# means:
# Seat 1 → Alice
# Seat 2 → Bob
# Seat 3 → Charlie
for arrangement in seating_charts:
    print(arrangement)

# Output:
# Total seating arrangements: 6
# ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie')
# ('Alice', 'Charlie', 'Bob')
# ('Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie')
# ('Bob', 'Charlie', 'Alice')
# ('Charlie', 'Alice', 'Bob')
# ('Charlie', 'Bob', 'Alice')
```
**Explanation:** Unlike `product`, `permutations` doesn't allow an item to be used more than once, and order matters (Alice-Bob-Charlie is different from Charlie-Bob-Alice). It instantly generates all $n!$ (n-factorial) arrangements.

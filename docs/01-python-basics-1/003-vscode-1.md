### 5 Python workflow in VS Code

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### A Beginner’s VS Code + Python Workflow (Step-by-Step)

This is the simplest workflow for complete beginners.


#### 5.1 Step 1: Install Python

Download from:- https://www.python.org/downloads/

During installation, tick this box:

✔ **Add Python to PATH** (very important)

#### 5.2 Step 2: Install VS Code


(You already have the installation steps earlier.)

#### 5.3 Step 3: Install Python extension in VS Code


*   Open VS Code → Left toolbar → Extensions icon (square) →

*   Search for Python
*   Install the official Microsoft extension.

#### 5.4 Step 4: Create a folder for your project


For example:

`D:\\Python\_Projects\\MyFirstProject`

This folder will hold _all_ your code files.


#### 5.5 Step 5: Open the folder in VS Code


VS Code → **File → Open Folder** → Select your folder.

This is important because VS Code needs a **workspace folder**.


#### 5.6 Step 6: Create a Python file


In Explorer:

➡ Click **New File**  
Name it:- `main.py`

  

#### 5.7 Step 7: Write your code


Example:

`print("Hello World!")`


#### 5.8 Step 8: Open the VS Code Terminal

Shortcut:

~~~
Ctrl + `
~~~

This opens a terminal panel at the bottom.


#### 5.9 Step 9: Run your Python script


Type:- `python main.py`

Press Enter.

You will see:

`Hello World!`


That’s it — you completed the basic workflow!

### 6. How to Create a Python Project

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Here are the recommended steps for beginners.

#### 6.1 Step 1: Create a folder



Example:

`C:\Python\My_App`

#### 6.2 Step 2: Add subfolders (optional but good practice)

```python
My_App/  
    ├── main.py
    ├── helper\_functions.py    
    └── data/
```

Note that every project having multiple files has to have an entry point. By convention, though not required, the entry point is often named main.py. Why Do We Use It?

1.                 The name `main.py` serves a clear purpose for both humans and tools.

2.                 Identifies the Entry Point: It immediately signals to anyone reading the project (another developer, a user, or even your future self) that this file contains the primary execution logic.

3.                 Facilitates Command Line Execution: When you run a project from the command line, you must specify which file to execute. Using a consistent name like main.py makes running the application straightforward: python main.py.

4.                 Project Structure and Packaging: When you package a complex Python application or library (e.g., using setuptools), you often need to define an "entry point" script. Naming your core script main.py keeps the internal project logic clean and predictable.

#### 6.3 Step 3: Open the folder in VS Code


`File → Open Folder → Select My_App`

#### 6.4 Step 4: Add Python files


Examples:

*  ` main.py` → main program
*   `helper_functions.py` → reusable functions
*   `config.py` → any settings

#### 6.5 Step 5: Install required libraries (optional)


`Terminal → run:`

`pip install requests`

`pip install numpy`

### 7. How to Run Python Scripts in VS Code

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

There are **3 beginner methods**:

#### 7.1 Method 1: Using Terminal (most recommended)

Open terminal:

~~~python
Ctrl + `

~~~

Run:

`python main.py`

✔ Works always  
✔ Most reliable  
✔ Teaches real-world workflow

#### 7.2 Method 2: Using the Run Button (triangle icon)

In a Python file, VS Code may show a **Run Python File** button on top.

Click it → Output appears in **TERMINAL**.

  

#### 7.3 Method 3: Using Code Runner Extension (optional)

Install **Code Runner** → A ▶ icon appears.

Run code with one click.

Not recommended for advanced use, but beginners like it.

### 9 Debug

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 9.1 Debugging Python Code in VS Code (Beginner Guide)**

Debugging means:  
✔ finding mistakes  
✔ stopping the program at certain points  
✔ checking variable values  
✔ running line-by-line

#### 9.2 Make sure Python extension is installed

Left toolbar → Extensions → search for Python

Install the **Microsoft Python extension**.

#### 9.2 Create a small sample file to debug

Example file:- `debug_example.py`

```python
def add(x, y):
    result = x + y
    return result
a = 10
b = 5
total = add(a, b)
print("The total is:->", total)


```

#### 9.3 Set a BREAKPOINT

A **breakpoint** stops your program temporarily.

How to set:- (a) Click on the **left margin** next to the line number. (b) You will see a **red dot** • (c) Clicking on the red dot adds a breakpoint

#### 9.4 Start debugging

Go to the left toolbar → Click the **Run & Debug icon** (a play button with a bug).

OR press:- F5

##### First time only:

You will see:-Select a debug configuration

Choose:- Python: Current File

#### 9.5 Program stops at the breakpoint

Now the program pauses on the red dot.

You can now inspect everything.

#### 9.6 Debugger Tools You Will See

When stopped at a breakpoint, a debug toolbar appears at the top:

| Button | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ▶ Continue | Run normally until next breakpoint |
| ↷ Step Over | Run next line (skip inside functions) |
| ↳ Step Into | Go inside function line-by-line |
| ↺ Step Out | Finish current function and return |

#### 9.7 Watch variable values

When you debug code, sometimes you want to keep an eye on certain variables without constantly printing them or searching for them in the call stack.  
The **Watch** panel lets you do exactly that.

##### 9.7.1 Where they appear

While debugging, open:

View → Run and Debug → WATCH panel (left sidebar)

##### 9.7.2 Inspect Watch Variables

The **Side Bar** in the **Run and Debug** view provides several panels for inspection:

##### 9.7.3 A. Variables

This panel automatically shows the current value of all **Local** variables (variables defined within the current function/scope) and **Global** variables. As you step through the code, these values update in real-time.

##### 9.7.4 B. Watch

The **Watch** panel allows you to explicitly monitor variables or expressions.

1.  Click the **Add Expression** button (usually a + icon) in the **Watch** panel.
2.  Type the name of a **variable** (e.g., my\_list) or a **complex expression** (e.g., len(my\_list) > 5).
3.  The value of the watched variable/expression will be displayed and updated automatically every time the debugger pauses. This is helpful for keeping track of key values across multiple steps.

##### 9.7.5 C. Call Stack

This panel shows the sequence of function calls that led to the current line of execution, which is helpful for understanding program flow.

##### 9.7.6 D. Debug Console

You can execute arbitrary Python commands and evaluate expressions in the **Debug Console** (found in the **Panel** at the bottom) while the code is paused. For example, you can type print(my\_variable) or even change a variable's value directly.

#### 9.8 What you can do with Watch Variables

*   Add a variable name (e.g., count, user.name)
*   Add expressions (e.g., a + b, len(items))
*   VS Code will **update their values live** as you step through the program.

##### 9.8.1 Why Watch Variables are useful

*   Track how a value changes over time
*   Debug logic errors
*   Avoid adding temporary print statements
*   Inspect nested objects or expressions easily

##### 9.8.1 Hover to inspect variables

Simply place your mouse over any variable:

Example:

Hover over a → small popup shows:

`10`

Very useful!

##### 9.8.2 Adding a new breakpoint

You can add multiple breakpoints on different lines.

Example:  
Add one inside the function:

`result = x + y`

Now debugging will stop inside the function too.

##### 9.8.3 ✔ Example Debugging Flow (beginner)

1.  Start debugging (F5)
2.  Execution stops at breakpoint
3.  Hover variables to see values
4.  Click "Step Into" to enter function
5.  Move line by line
6.  Watch how variables change
7.  Click "Continue" to finish

### 10 Debugging common beginner mistakes

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 10.1 ❌ Error example:-

`print(result)`

But you never defined result.

Debugger will show:

`NameError: name 'result' is not defined`

You can use "Call Stack" + stepping to find where it failed.

#### 10.2 Debugging input() programs

If your script has `input()`:

`name = input("Enter your name: ")`

Debugger will pause and ask for input in terminal.

#### 10.3 Debug Configuration (optional)

VS Code may create a `.vscode/launch.json` file.

Beginners do NOT need to edit it.

Just choose:

Python: Current File

#### 10.3 Summary: VS Code Debug Steps

1.  Open your Python file
2.  Set a breakpoint (red dot)
3.  Press **F5** (Run & Debug)
4.  Program pauses
5.  Inspect variables
6.  Step line-by-line
7.  Fix mistakes

#### 13 VS Code IntelliSense FAQ

##### 1 What is IntelliSense?

IntelliSense is VS Code’s smart auto-completion feature.  
It helps you by showing:

*   function names
*   variable suggestions
*   method lists
*   documentation tooltips

It saves time and prevents typing mistakes.

##### 2 Why is IntelliSense not showing up?

Common reasons:

  
*   Python extension is not installed
  
*   Wrong interpreter is selected
  
*   Errors in your code prevent suggestions
  
*   File is not saved as .py

Fix:  
Check bottom-right → ensure it shows a Python version (e.g., “Python 3.10”).  
If not, click and choose your Python installation.

##### 3 How do I manually trigger IntelliSense?

Press: Ctrl + Space

This forces IntelliSense to open suggestions even if it did not pop up automatically.

##### 4 How do I see function details / documentation?

Hover your mouse over a function, variable, or class.

VS Code will show:

  
*   description
*   parameter list
*   return type (when available)

  
##### 5 IntelliSense works in one project but not another. Why?

Possibilities:

  
*   Different virtual environments
*   Missing packages
  
*   Wrong Python interpreter selected for that folder

Fix:  
Select the correct interpreter from the bottom-right corner after opening the proper folder.

  

##### 6 Does IntelliSense work without internet?

Yes!  
VS Code’s IntelliSense works entirely offline because it reads:

  
*   Python libraries
*   Your project code
*   Installed packages

  

##### 7 IntelliSense is slow or lagging. What can I do?

Try:

1.  Restart VS Code
2.  Close heavy programs
3.  Disable unused extensions
4.  Update VS Code
5.  Update Python extension

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

##### 8 IntelliSense doesn’t detect installed libraries (like numpy). Why?

Most common cause:  
VS Code is using a different Python than the one you installed packages into.

Fix:

*   Go to Terminal → python --version
*   Go to VS Code bottom-right → pick the same version

#####  9 How do I get IntelliSense for project-specific files?

If VS Code is not showing suggestions from your own .py files:

*   Ensure your files are inside the same folder/project
*   Save the file
*   Restart VS Code

#####  10 How do I enable/disable IntelliSense?

Go to:

File → Settings → Search “IntelliSense”

You can turn On/Off:

*   Auto suggestions
*   Parameter hints
*   Quick suggestions

#####  11 IntelliSense shows wrong or confusing suggestions. What do I do?

Try:

*   Clear Python language server cache
*   Switch the language server

Options:

*   _Pylance (recommended)_
*   _Jedi_

Switch via settings → "Python: Language Server".

#####  12 My IntelliSense is giving suggestions from old code. Why?

Because VS Code cached your workspace.

Fix:

*   Close VS Code completely
*   Reopen the project folder

Or use Developer: Reload Window from command palette.

#####  13 How do I get IntelliSense inside virtual environments?

Just activate the environment in VS Code and select it as the interpreter.

#####   14 How do I get IntelliSense to show parameters while typing?

When typing inside parentheses → press:

Ctrl + Shift + Space

#####   15 IntelliSense doesn’t work with .ipynb files (Jupyter notebooks). Why?

It does work, but:

*   Performance may be slower
*   Suggestions may appear differently

Make sure Jupyter extension is installed.
